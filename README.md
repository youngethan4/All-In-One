# All-In-One
The main purpose of this app was to make a lot of little single player fun apps and games. 
Then I decided, why not make the one "little" game, a memory game, the whole app with many features?
With this being said, I have created the database, user profiles, high scores, and started on implementing multiplayer for this game.
Unfortunetly I now have lost interest in resuming the game and have focused my time on more apps than games.

The login activity contains two seperate threads. one for logging in and one for creating an account.
By swiping right or left or using the tabs on top, the user can navigate to the fragment they need to use. 
Right now, there is one game mode that the user will have access to after logging in. 
This mode times you as you play, and that time is the score. There is an option for 
30 cards though making the game a bit more challenging. 
The user has the choice of what theme they like best which changes every activities colors. 
There is also sound and music that play thoughout the app and can be muted in the quick settings.
