# All-In-One
The main purpose of this app was to make a lot of little single player fun apps and games. 
Then I decided, why not make the one "little" game, a memory game, multiplayer.
With this being said, I am now working on implementing a multiplayer version of the game.
I have created the database, user profiles, and am going to move high scores onto the database.
I plan to implement oath2.0 for users to login with facebook and google.
Unfortuanatly, this is now going very slow as I have just resumed my computer engineering studies. 
One day, this will be available for the public to download and most likely will be thrown onto the
android play store before coding in swift will begin. 

The login activity contains two seperate threads. one for logging in and one for creating an account.
By swiping right or left or using the tabs on top, the user can navigate to the thread they need to use. 
Right now, there is one game mode that the user will have access to after logging in. 
This mode times you as you play, and that time is the score. There is an option for 
30 cards though making the game a bit more challenging. 
The user has the choice of what theme they like best which changes every activities colors. 
There is also sound and music that play thoughout the app and can be muted in the quick settings.
